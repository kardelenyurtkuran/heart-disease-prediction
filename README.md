# Heart Disease Prediction
This repository contains a comprehensive data science project focused on analyzing and predicting heart disease risks using the Heart Disease Dataset from IEEE Dataport. The project encompasses data preprocessing, visualization, classification/prediction, and advanced machine learning techniques.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

### 1. Data Preprocessing:
Apply at least four preprocessing methods to improve data quality and justify their necessity.

### 2. Data Visualization:
Create at least four visualizations using Python to explore the dataset and provide meaningful insights.

### 3. Classification/Predictive Modeling:
Treat the problem as a classification or regression task.
Implement and compare the performance of various machine learning models, including:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Naive Bayes
Regression/Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Support Vector Machines (SVM/SVR)
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

### 4. Model Evaluation and Optimization:
Evaluate overfitting and underfitting for Random Forest models by experimenting with different parameters.
Test at least three different parameter configurations for each model and compare their performance.

### 5. Developing a Bagged SVM/SVR (T-SVM/T-SVR) Method:
Propose and implement a custom method combining feature selection and random sampling.
Include pseudocode and Python implementation for the developed method.

## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Heart Disease Dataset available on IEEE Dataport. It contains comprehensive attributes relevant to heart disease diagnosis and prediction. For more details on the dataset attributes, please refer to the official documentation.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze the structure and attributes of the dataset.
Identify missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues.

### 2. Preprocessing:
Apply techniques such as:
Handling missing data
Scaling and normalization
Encoding categorical variables
Feature selection or extraction

### 3. Visualization:
Use libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to create interactive and informative graphs.

### 4. Model Training and Evaluation:
Train various models and optimize their parameters.
Compare performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

### 5. Custom Method Development:
Implement a Bagged SVM/SVR model and evaluate its performance against baseline models.
